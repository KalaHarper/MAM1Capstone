Use case:
User starts program. Vending machine displays welcome menu with options
User most likely selects first option; displaying items
User is returned to main menu, user most likely selects purchase
Vending machine makes internal calculations based on user's selection
Vending machine prompts user for currency, most likely in coins
Vending machine makes internal calculation for fewest amount of coins to return
Vending machine dispenses product and appropriate change; updates internal log

Start Machine
	1)(Main) Construct a new Menu object with System.in , System.out
	parameters
	2)(Main)Construct a new VendingMachineCLI object with an instance of
	Menu object as a parameter
	Set Initial State
		3) (VendingMachineCLI Constructor)Construct new Item
		Stockable
		4)(VendingMachineCLI Constructor)Construct new Currency
		Stockable
	Display Opening Menu
		5)(Main)VendingMachineCLI instance calls run method; Starts
		open while loop {String = menu method call
		getChoiceFromOptions(Objects[] options)
		while


1) Redundant cuz obvs
2) COMPLETE!! WOOP! WOOP!
    added an else if to the run method, creating the exit option which
    closes the program
3) Create a file reader for the csv file. Preferably automated. Can turn the different
    columns into data for each object in the vending machine
    Reference "Vending Machine Data File" at the bottom of the README
4) Redundant: restated in 5
5) User selects 1 and sees:
    Slot Identifier, Name, Current Inventory(Starts at 5 a piece; SOLD OUT when empty)
6) User selects 2 and sees:
    Purchase menu (Reference read me)
